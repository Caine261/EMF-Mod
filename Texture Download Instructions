Create a folder called server in the default textures folder as seen below
minetest-0.4.15-win64\minetest-0.4.15-win64\textures

Next download the images above as png's to the new server folder and you should have file paths that look like this
minetest-0.4.15-win64\minetest-0.4.15-win64\textures\server\apple_juice

Good Job!
